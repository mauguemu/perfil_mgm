Heritage is one of the main tools for the preservation of the history of our society. Over time and after the recognition of its importance, its conception and the list of elements subject to asset valuation have been transformed.
Currently one of the main challenges that heritage conservation faces is the loss of appreciation and transmission of heritage values to future generations, heritage documentation being one of the main tools for its dissemination.
However, in a context of globalization and in the face of this new technological revolution in which communication and information barriers have broken the old paradigms, documentation cannot be a static instrument that is archived with the sole objective of recording history, Rather, it must be a tool for the awareness of the population and the worldwide exposure of the elements that have been part of the construction of our civilizations.
Given this, the use of geographic information systems, digital databases and web viewers has been explored as a tool for registering heritage assets and even more so for their open transmission. So that while promoting the dissemination and appropriation of heritage, the doors are opened for the exchange of knowledge in a globalized way and in other ways of knowledge.
